#Notes on Installing Haddop on the workers

This is based on http://www.server-world.info/en/note?os=CentOS_7&p=hadoop

I'm using an existing key.

Also installing hadoop in /opt/hadoop where hadoop is a soft link to the name of the top directory
of the untared tar ball.

## I added run.sh in Oct 2016

This just installs the files in Opt.  This is to make it so that spark client works.
