## Go Binaries

With Go, you get a binary for the correct architecture (linix-amd-64 or darwin-amd-64)
and then make it executable and 'go'!

In this directory should be all the instructions and scripts to get the right 
binaries into this location.  Currently you can curl hashicorp consul and vault but the
prometheus and traefik download sites return web pages for that.  

The binaries themselves should not go into the repo.  Just how to get the binaries
into these directories.
